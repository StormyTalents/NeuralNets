# NeuralNets
Tests of various neural nets in TensorFlow
<h3>
  A collection of various neural network models in TensorFlow.
</h3>

<p>
  This project consists of a collection of neural network models that I have trained on various datasets (eg. MNIST for digit classification with a CNN). Above, you'll see a simple example of a model that has learned to classify points of each of the four labels (i.e. colors) it's been given.
